The data structure takes O ̃ ( n 3.375 ) time to build, using O ( m n 1.5 log n ) space, and each query takes O ( k n ) time, which is optimal and beats the previous query time of O ( k n α ( n ) ) .

    abstract ={Street parking spots for automobiles are a scarce commodity in most urban environments. The heterogeneity of car sizes makes it inefficient to rigidly define fixed-sized spots. Instead, unmarked streets in cities like New York leave placement decisions to individual drivers, who have no direct incentive to maximize street utilization. 
  In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of two different behavioral interventions designed to encourage better parking, namely (1) educational campaigns to encourage parkers to "kiss the bumper" and reduce the distance between themselves and their neighbors, or (2) painting appropriately-spaced markings on the street and urging drivers to "hit the line". Through analysis and simulation, we establish that the greatest densities are achieved when lines are painted to create spots roughly twice the length of average-sized cars. Kiss-the-bumper campaigns are in principle more effective than hit-the-line for equal degrees of compliance, although we believe that the visual cues of painted lines induce better parking behavior.}

abstract = {A closed curve in the plane is weakly simple if it is the limit (in the Fréchet metric) of a sequence of simple closed curves. We describe an algorithm to determine whether a closed walk of length n in a simple plane graph is weakly simple in O(n log n) time, improving an earlier O(n3)-time algorithm of Cortese et al. [Discrete Math. 2009]. As an immediate corollary, we obtain the first efficient algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary n-vertex polygon is weakly simple; our algorithm runs in O(n2 log n) time. We also describe algorithms that detect weak simplicity in O(n log n) time for two interesting classes of polygons. Finally, we discuss subtle errors in several previously published definitions of weak simplicity.},

abstract={Large-volume CdZnTe (CZT) single crystals with electron lifetime exceeding 10 mus have recently become commercially available. This opened the opportunity for making room temperature CZT gamma-ray detectors with extended thicknesses and larger effective areas. However, the extended defects that are present even in the highest-quality material remain a major drawback which affects the availability and cost of large CZT detectors. In contrast to the point defects that control electron lifetime and whose effects on the charge collection can be electronically corrected, the extended defects introduce significant fluctuations in the collected charge, which increase with a crystal's thickness. The extended defects limit the uniformity in the electrons' drift distance in CZT crystals, above which electron trapping cannot effectively be corrected. In this paper, we illustrate the roles of the extended defects in CZT detectors with different geometries. We emphasize that the crystallinity of commercial CZT materials remains a major obstacle on the path to developing thick, large-volume CZT detectors for gamma-ray imaging and spectroscopy.},
